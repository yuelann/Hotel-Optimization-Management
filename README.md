### Dataset ###
The [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) can be found on Kaggle containing different attributes of customers' reservation details.

### Findings ###
We implemented a dynamic pricing strategy for a European hotel, forecasting demand and optimizing room prices using linear regression. The model, based on historical reservation data, maximized revenue for room types 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 over a 17-week period in 2018. Our linear optimization model outperformed the actual hotel revenue by 0.4%, suggesting potential additional earnings of $6,327.83 per year. Despite limitations like inconsistent data and lack of competitor pricing information, we recommend Hotel Europe implement the strategy for better-matched supply and demand, leading to increased yearly revenues.
